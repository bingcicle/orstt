# orstt
Partial implementation of Orst, a collection of sorting algorithm implementations in Rust, inspired by [orst](https://github.com/jonhoo/orst) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo). Adding in extra algorithms not covered in his repository just for exploratory purposes.

Algorithms:
1. Insertion sort
2. Bubble sort
3. Shell sort

Decided to implement [shell sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort) since it wasn't implemented in his repo as an exercise.
